-- Create a new table called customer_review, which will contain film reviews that customers will make.

-- Think about the DELETE constraint: if a film is deleted, its review should be automatically deleted.
-- It should have the following columns:
-- review_id ‚Äì a primary key, non null, auto-increment.
-- film_id ‚Äì references the new_film table. The film that is being reviewed.
-- language_id ‚Äì references the language table. What language the review is in.

-- score ‚Äì the rating of the review (1-10).
-- review_text ‚Äì the text of the review. No limit on the length.
-- last_update ‚Äì when the review was last updated.
